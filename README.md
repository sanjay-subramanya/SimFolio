## ðŸ“Š Features

- **Instant Scenario Simulation**: Simulate stock price changes and see portfolio impact
- **Correlation-Based Modeling**: Account for how stocks move together in your portfolio
- **Component Analysis**: Clear overview of overall and individual stock effects

## ðŸ§  Architecture

A **Temporal Attention Graph Neural Network** that models stocks as nodes in a dynamic graph, where:

- **Graph Structure**: Stocks represent nodes, with edges weighted by historical correlations
- **Temporal Modeling**: Processes sequential price data to capture time-dependent patterns
- **Attention Mechanism**: Learns which historical time periods and stock relationships matter most for impact prediction

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjay-subramanya/SimFolio.git
cd SimFolio
```

### Install Dependencies

1. **Backend Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

2. **Frontend Dependencies**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

## ðŸ”§ Running the Application

### Backend Server (API Endpoints)

Navigate to the backend directory and start the FastAPI server:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn router:app --reload --port 8000
```

The server will start at port 8000 with API documentation available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

### Frontend Visualizer

Navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000. Ensure the backend server first is running to enable all features.

### Training Only

To train the network without the frontend interface:

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```
